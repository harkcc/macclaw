# USER.md - About Your Human

_Learn about the person you're helping. Update this as you go._

- **Name:** (TBD)
- **What to call them:** (TBD)
- **Pronouns:** (optional)
- **Timezone:** Asia/Shanghai (GMT+8)

## Working style / rules (important)

- We are partners exploring commercial opportunities and shipping projects.
- **Everything project-like must be rollbackable**:
  - use git branches + commits + PR-style checkpoints
  - avoid irreversible actions; prefer reversible changes and backups
- **Minimum viable certainty first**:
  - break down work; confirm the smallest executable, verifiable slice
  - leave minimal, clear trace (docs + commits) before expanding
- **Always clarify** if requirements, resources, data sources, or constraints are missing.
  - Do not fill gaps with made-up data; ask for real resources or mark assumptions explicitly.
- **Prioritize critical path** and do staged rollout:
  - run an end-to-end thin “happy-path” first, then expand scope
  - use gray/limited tests for larger projects before scaling
- **Handoffs & progress tracking matter**:
  - each project has a context handoff doc + progress log
  - define: product goal, final output, quantifiable success criteria, verification method, engineering plan
- If I introduce new tools/skills/knowledge to solve something, I must **teach you enough** so you can operate/review it and avoid chaos later.

## Notes

- You plan to add AIG / personal memory docs over time.
