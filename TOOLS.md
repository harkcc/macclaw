# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:

- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Examples

```markdown
### Cameras

- living-room → Main area, 180° wide angle
- front-door → Entrance, motion-triggered

### SSH

- home-server → 192.168.1.100, user: admin

### Storage (external "Big Data" drive)

- Purpose: store large datasets and oversized project assets (user: 500GB external drive)
- Rule: anything placed there must also be recorded in a local index (name → external path → notes) so it can be found later

### Session governance (avoid context loss)

- Prefer starting a new chat/session at topic/phase boundaries.
- Use "Compacting context" only as a temporary bridge mid-procedure.
- Before switching sessions: do a 60-second checkpoint (decisions/next step/pointers) and promote to runbooks/projects/index/Notes.

### TTS

- Preferred voice: "Nova" (warm, slightly British)
- Default speaker: Kitchen HomePod
```

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.
